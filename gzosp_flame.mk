# This file is the build configuration for an aosp Android
# build for marlin hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, aosp and du, hence its name.
